#Data files used for analysis in the manuscript "Sputum Microbiome is Associated With 1-Year Mortality Following COPD Hospitalizations" 
#Status: Manuscript Submitted (Under Revision - R2)
Authors: Leitao Filho et al. 

NOTE: 10 sputum samples provided very low number of sequencing reads and thus were excluded during downstream analysis:
      COPD-015, COPD-025, COPD-049, COPD-052, COPD-082, COPD-083, COPD-086, COPD-090, COPD-093, COPD-108. 

NOTE: The files present in this folder are based on sequencing data from the 102 sputum samples included in 
      the final analysis in the manuscript.
