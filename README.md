#Sputum Microbiome is Associated With 1-Year Mortality Following COPD Hospitalizations

Description

Lung microbiome data based on sputum samples collected from COPD patients enrolled in the Rapid Transition Cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02050022). All samples (n=112) were collected on day 1 of hospitalization due to acute exacerbation of COPD. 1-Year mortality status was also captured during follow-up. 

Sequence data from all sputum samples used in this analysis have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the following accession numbers: BioProject PRJNA491749 and SRA study accession SRP162074. 

In this public Repository, the BIOM files (based on rarefied and non-rarified feature tables), phylogenetic tree file, metadata table and bioinformatics codes used in QIIME2™ and R are available. Questions: please contact Fernando Studart (fernando.studart@hli.ubc.ca).
